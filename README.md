Jumping Frogs is a game for your phone. It has 10 levels. They are:

- jumping frogs
- breathing dragon
- swimming fish
- trolls and bridges
- villagers and giants
- swimming mermaids

## Jumping Frogs

In this level there are several jumping frogs. As they jump, you will click on one
and that one will go up. You are trying to get him to land on a grassy dirt area
that's higher up.

The game is named jumping frogs, and the first level has jumping frogs, but there
are several additional levels.

## Breathing Dragon

It has two screens: one screen where you can click continue, and one screen where you do the fighting.

You will be standing on dirt, and you'll be fighting the dragon. You have a sword, and the dragon can
burn your sword using his fire. You fight him by running up to him and then swinging your sword (just
like the in villagers and giants).

## Swimming Fish

The background will be blue, and on the bottom there will be seaweed. There will be lots of fish swimming,
and you're trying to get them to swim over to the gold. The gold will be moving around, so it's hard to
get the fish to touch the gold. Also, the gold will be in a treasure box.
